# Twenty-First Century Amateur Radio

  "Software Defined Radio isn't the future, it is now."

## Vision:

A Software Defined Radio that is fully controllable by a web browser in a remote computer or touchscreen device.  There is  technology today to do sufficiently performant raster and vector graphics directly in the browser.  Pushing data to the browser over a persistent http connection is possible so very low latency clients are no problem, even without Java or Flash.

We've recently seen the introduction of USB interfaces on commercial radios providing PCM and I/Q data.  I want to move to ethernet.  The soon-to-be-available Raspberry Pi will be the minimum performance level this project will support.  This will allow for experimentation with sub-$150 radios that are actually redundantly-networked servers with gigabytes of local storage.  The possibilities for emergency communications, marine use, and propagation detection are enormous.

## Team:

#### John Williams KE5SSH, Project Management

I would be glad to help out with testing and debug as you progress. I have a Ensemble, a 6.3ng and a widget, plus a pretty good background in Linux. That is my preferred platform.  I can also help with documentation on a wiki.

#### David Turnbull KF7TEE, Server Developer

I'm currently working on the DSP and server code.  I will often be building the prototype client side code as well.
